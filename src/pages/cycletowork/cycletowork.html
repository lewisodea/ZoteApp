	<h3>What is the cycle to work scheme?</h3>
	<p>
		Zotefoams is now offering 'Cycle to Work', a government-approved
		employee benefit that allows you to save at least 25% on the cost
		of a new bicycle - and to pay for it in 12 monthly instalments 
		deducted from your pay before tax. After this initial hire period
		you fully own the bicycle.
	</p>

	<h3>What are the benefits of the scheme?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Eligible employees can repay the cost of the bicycle and equipment
			through salary sacrifice over a period of 12 months.
		</li>
		<li>
			Employees will save NI and income tax on the cost of their bicycle
			- a minimum saving of 25%.
		</li>
		<li>
			Scheme members can choose any bicycle and equipment up to a maximum
			of £1000 from a participating store.
		</li>
		<li>
			It is an affordable way to get a top-quality bike that will be lighter
			and easier to ride than that old one you found in the shed!
		</li>
		<li>
			Riding a bike instead of driving to work is great for the environment,
			great for your health and saves you money on fuel.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>How can I take advantage of the scheme?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Head over to a participating cycle shop (ask HR for a list of participating
			stores) and choose your bicycle and equipment to get a quote.
		</li>
		<li>
			Submit the quote online at <a href="https://cyclescheme.co.uk"></a>
			www.cyclescheme.co.uk. You need to input our code which is
			<strong>91ef15</strong>. This is then sent to us for authorisation and payment.
		</li>
		<li>
			You sign the hire agreement, receive the voucher which you then take to the shop
			to claim your new bicycle.
		</li>
		<li>
			Go for a ride!
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Who can participate in the scheme and are there any limitations?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			You should cycle to work at least 50% of the time and the bike must be
			for your personal use.
		</li>
		<li>
			You must spend a minimum of £200 and no more than £1,000.
		</li>
		<li>
			There is a Fair Market charge of 5% but do not forget that you save on
			NI and income tax.
		</li>
		<li>
			Just as if you purchased this equipment from any retailer, you are responsible
			for the equipment, so you are strongly recommended to insure against any damage
			or loss, as payments will continue even if the equipment is stolen, damaged or
			not working.
		</li>
		<li>
			If you leave the company for any reason, any outstanding balance will be deducted
			from your final net pay. If your net salary is insufficient then you must settle
			the balance within 14 days.
		</li>
		<li>
			Employees must not be subject to any disciplinary action for conduct issues or
			absence or have unexpired warnings.
		</li>
		<li>
			The scheme is discretionary, an employee's request might not be approved for any
			reason, but this will not be withheld unreasonably. 
		</li>
		<li>
			The Company may vary these terms without notice for any new participant to the
			scheme and may withdraw the scheme at any time.
		</li>
	</ul>
