    <h2>FAQ Page</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>How do I request IT support?</summary>
      <p>
        The best way to contact IT is via <a href="mailto:systems@zotefoams.com">
        <strong>systems@zotefoams.com</strong></a>, 
        this will generate a support ticket in our system.
      </p>

    <details>
      <summary>How long can I expect to wait to recieve support?</summary>
      <p>
        We always endeavour to provide support as quickly as possible,
        however during especially busy times, the priority system will be
        closley followed, and your ticket may be placed on hold if it is
        of a lower priority.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, should the there be a fault in any computers that the
        factory machines rely on to operate, this will become the highest
        priority. Once high priority calls have been resolved, any available
        agent will aim to answer your ticket in a timely manner.

      <summary>What does it mean if I am a "Primary Owner" for a Rollcall printer?</summary>
      <p>
        If you are a Primary Owner, your duties are as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          On the weekly fire alarm test, every Tuesday at 10:00AM, you will need to check
          your local printer after the alarm has finished, and check that the Rollcall Report
          has printed.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are not in the office on one of these days, please inform the Secondary Owner
          of the printer, so that they can fulfill this duty. If you are unsure of who your
          Secondary Owner is, please contact us and we'll fill you in.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you have checked if the Rollcall Report has printed, please email <a href="mailto:rollcall@zotefoams.com">
          <strong>rollcall@zotefoams.com</strong></a> with the status.
        </li>
        <li>
          You do not need to keep the report, it can be recycled once you have sent the confirmation email.
        </li>
        <li>
          This procedure is carried out for Health & Safety reasons. In the event of a fire, these reports
          will automatically print so we know exactly who is on site, and can accurately check for any missing
          persons. 
  
          If you have any questions or concerns regarding the procedure, please put them forward to
          <a href="mailto:rollcall@zotefoams.com"><strong>rollcall@zotefoams.com</strong></a>
        </li>
      </ul>
